# MyBasicProjects

These are some of my beginner projects:

 numberGuesser:
 This is a basic small game that has a random number generator. It let's you guess the number and depending on your answer it outputs a different line. If you guess the random generated number you win the game and the program finishes.
 
 
Clever Lily:
 The problem for the solution is: Lily is now N years old. For every one of her birthdays she recieves a gift. For the odd birthdays she recieves toys and for the even birthdays she recieves money. For her second birthday she recieves 10 leva (Bulgarian currency) and the amount of money is increased with 10 leva each even birthday. Through the years Lily saves her money. Each year, when she recieves the money, her brother takes 1 lev from them. Lily sold all of her toys that she had recieved through the years, each one of the toys for P leva and added the sum to they saved money. With the money she wanted to buy a washing machine for herself for X leva. The program should compute how much money she has saved and if that sum is enough to buy the washing machine.
 
 OddEvenSumm:
 The problem for this solution is: The program should read a number N given by the user that is going to be the amount of number the user will then input in the program. After the numbers are inputed the program should get their sum, the minimum and the maximum of the number in the odd posiotions and the even position If there are not enough elements to make a sum of them, the program should write "No".
 
 Ski:
 The problem for this solution is: John wants to go on a ski vacation. Before he goes he has to book a hotel and calculate how much it would cost him. The "room for one person" is 18 leva, the "apartment" is 25 and the "president apartment" is 35 leva per night. Depending on the days he will be spending there (2 days = 1 night) and depending on the type of room or apartment he is booking he can use a certain discount: If he wants to stay less than 10 days in the "apartment", the discount is 30% and in the "president apartment", the discound is 10%. If he wants to stay more than 10 days and less than 15 days the discount is 35% and in the "president apartment", the discound is 15%. If he wants to stay more than 15 in the "apartment", the discount is 50% and in the "president apartment", the discound is 20%. There is no discount for the "room for one person". After his stay in the given room John has to choose if his stay was good or bad, if it was bad he has to type in "negative", if it was good he has to type in "positive". Depending on the rating he gives, he will either pay less or more. If he says "positive" he pays 25% more and if it is "negative" he pays 10% less. The program should compute how much he has to pay.
